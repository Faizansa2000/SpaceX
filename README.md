# SpaceX Missions Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This portfolio project explores the SpaceX missions dataset, which contains records of each payload carried during SpaceX missions into outer space. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and includes information scraped from the SpaceX and NASA websites. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize various aspects of SpaceX missions, such as launch frequency, success rates, payload types, and more.

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** [SpaceX Missions Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spacex/spacex-missions)
- **Contents:** The dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space. Each record contains information such as mission name, launch date and time, launch site, payload type, mission outcome, and customer country.
- **Acknowledgements:** The data was scraped from the SpaceX and NASA websites.

## Analysis and Visualization

### Data Exploration

- Explored the structure of the dataset
- Examined columns and their meanings
- Checked for missing values
- Obtained an overview of the data

### Visualization

- Plotted the number of launches over time to analyze launch frequency trends
- Visualized the success rates of missions to identify patterns or changes over time
- Analyzed the distribution of payloads to understand the types of payloads carried during SpaceX missions
- Created various other visualizations to explore different aspects of the data

### Statistical Analysis

- Conducted statistical analyses to identify patterns, correlations, or trends in the data
- Examined relationships between different variables and their impact on mission outcomes

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
  - Matplotlib: Used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
  - Seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization and making attractive and informative graphics

## Conclusion

This portfolio project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the SpaceX missions dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. By exploring various aspects of the data, we gain insights into SpaceX's mission history, trends, and patterns, which can inform future decision-making and analysis in the space industry.
